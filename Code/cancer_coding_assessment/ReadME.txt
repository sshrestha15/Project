Comments for the report. The file is zipped and after unzipping, you can  see four folders. Below are the description of the folders that you should be looking at.1) Source codes folder   The codes are written in python. There are two source codes for this assessment. 
i) “cancer_assessment.py” is the original code.ii) “cancer_assessment_modified_for_plot.py” is the modified code for making the scatter plot to improve the readability. Either of the code can be used but my report uses cancer_assessment_modified_for_plot.py.To run the python code, I used spider through anaconda environment. 2) Final result folder has all the files that I used for writing this report.3) Report folder has my report for this assessment. It has pdf and docx copy. You can use either one of them but docx is backup if the pdf does not open.
